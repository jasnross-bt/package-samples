# Hello World with Voleer

Template `hello-world` is an example of a very simple automation that can be created using Voleer.

The template contains only a single step, which calls task `echo` defined in package `getting-started`. The step passes a fixed string `"Hello, World!"` to the task and the task outputs it to the log.
