# Fun with Numbers

Template `fun-with-numbers` is an example of a simple automation that can be created using Voleer.

The template first presents the customer with a form where they can enter a number or a date, as well as type of information as such "trivia" or "math".

The template then uses task `get-number-fact` to get some interesting information about the value enter by the customer.

It then sends this information to the specified email address.
